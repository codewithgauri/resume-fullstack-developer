# Resume for Full Stack Developer

Last month, I reviewed 100+ resumes and distilled some key tips to make your tech resume stand out in the competitive field.

## 1. Quick Scan Technique:

- Take 10 seconds to scan your resume from the beginning.
- Focus on the first half-page, reading the first 5 words of each sentence or bullet point.
- Ensure your resume is packed with developer-oriented language like "Developed a REST API" or "Built a full-stack web app."

## 2. Tell a Story:

- Your resume should flow like a story, avoiding a laundry list of technical jargon.
- Use a format like [ACCOMPLISHMENT, IMPACT, CHALLENGE] to explain achievements.
- Example: "Developed a server-side layout engine in iOS, teaching myself GoLang to automate 1000+ manual layouts. Worked with a coworker to drive the project to completion, launching company-wide."

## 3. Pitfalls to Avoid:

- Skip non-engineering words like "Documented" or "Supported." Focus on development skills.
- Keep low-priority information (hobbies, irrelevant skills) towards the bottom.
- Don't spend too much time explaining the company or team; highlight personal contributions.

## 4. Last Impressions Count:

- Your resume has a last impression too.
- Avoid ending with forgettable details.
- Consider adding a touch of personality by sharing a cool hobby or project.
- Make yourself memorable as someone people want to meet.
